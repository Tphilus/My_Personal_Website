                       The one competition that he was good in was basketball. In his school, almost everyone was obsessed with sports,
                       and so did he. Every game period, his teacher would make them play basketball along with other games, and whiles playing games,
                       he discovered other lessons as well. One of the lessons he had leant was how to play in a team. When you play in group, you depend on each other for winning.
